Softlight Agent is an autonomous multi-agent automation system designed to execute real UI workflows (like “create a project in Linear” or “Delete a project in Linear”) without pre-defined selectors or hardcoded scripts.
It uses computer perception, natural language task planning, and contextual execution to understand and act on any modern web app’s interface.

Overview:

The system follows a closed-loop reasoning cycle:

Planning → Perception → Locator → Executor → Verifier → Recovery

Each module works together to complete a high-level goal such as “create a project in Linear” or “Delete a project in Linear” purely from the natural-language instruction.
